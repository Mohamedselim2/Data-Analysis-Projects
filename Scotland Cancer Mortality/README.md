## Project Overview: Scotland Cancer Mortality and Population Analysis (1994-2019)

### Description
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of cancer mortality data in Scotland from 1994 to 2019. The dataset includes information on the number of deaths by various cancer types over this period. Additionally, a separate dataset detailing the population of Scotland during the same period was used to provide context and support in-depth analysis.

### Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Perform a thorough examination of cancer mortality trends over 25 years.
- **Visualization**: Create visual representations to highlight key insights and trends in cancer mortality.
- **Modeling**: Develop statistical models to understand the factors influencing cancer mortality and predict future trends.
- **Exploration**: Investigate correlations between population changes and cancer mortality rates.

### Datasets
1. **Cancer Mortality Dataset**: Contains the number of deaths by cancer type from 1994 to 2019. Each entry includes:
   - Year
   - Cancer type
   - Number of deaths

2. **Population Dataset**: Provides the population of Scotland for each year from 1994 to 2019. Each entry includes:
   - Year
   - Total population

### Key Findings
- Significant trends in cancer mortality rates over the 25-year period.
- High mortality rates for specific cancer types such as lung, colorectal, and breast cancer.
- Correlation between population demographics and cancer mortality rates.

### Tools and Methods
- **Data Cleaning and Preparation**: Ensured data quality and consistency for accurate analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed statistical techniques to identify significant trends and patterns.
- **Visualization**: Used tools such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create informative visualizations.
- **Modeling**: Applied regression models to predict future cancer mortality rates based on historical data.

### Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into cancer mortality trends in Scotland over a 25-year period. The findings can help inform public health policies and resource allocation to address cancer more effectively.

### How to Use This Repository
