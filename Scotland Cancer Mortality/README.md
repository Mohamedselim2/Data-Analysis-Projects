#### Project Title: Scotland Cancer Mortality and Population Analysis (1994-2019)

#### Description:
This project involves comprehensive data analysis, visualization, and modeling of cancer mortality rates in Scotland from 1994 to 2019. Additionally, it includes an analysis of the population data for Scotland over the same period. The project aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of cancer mortality and how they relate to population changes.

#### Data Sets:
1. **Scotland Cancer Mortality (1994-2019)**
   - Contains detailed records of cancer-related deaths across various types of cancers.
   - Data includes year-wise death counts, categorized by cancer type.

2. **Scotland Population (1994-2019)**
   - Provides annual population figures for Scotland.
   - Used to correlate cancer mortality rates with population changes over the years.

#### Key Components:
1. **Data Analysis:**
   - Cleaning and preprocessing of raw data.
   - Statistical analysis to identify trends and significant changes in cancer mortality rates.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Creation of various charts and graphs to visually represent cancer mortality trends.
   - Comparison of cancer mortality data with population data to provide a clearer context.

3. **Modeling:**
   - Development of predictive models to forecast future cancer mortality rates based on historical data.
   - Analysis of factors contributing to changes in cancer mortality rates.

4. **Exploration:**
   - In-depth exploration of data to uncover hidden patterns and insights.
   - Interactive visualizations for better understanding and communication of findings.

5. **Full Report:**
   - A comprehensive PDF report detailing the methodology, analysis, results, and conclusions.
   - Includes all visualizations and modeling results, with explanations and interpretations.

#### Files Included:
- `scotland_cancer_mortality_1994_2019.csv`: Dataset containing cancer mortality records.
- `scotland_population_1994_2019.csv`: Dataset containing population figures.
- `Reporting.xlsx`: data analysis, visualization, and modeling.
- `full_report.pdf`: Detailed report summarizing the entire project, including findings and visualizations.

#### How to Use:
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Ensure all datasets are in the same directory as the analysis code.
   - Load the datasets into your preferred data analysis tool (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, RStudio).

2. **Running the Analysis:**
   - Open `analysis_code.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
   - Execute the cells to perform data analysis, create visualizations, and build models.

3. **Reviewing the Report:**
   - Open `full_report.pdf` to read the comprehensive analysis and findings of the project.

#### Conclusion:
This project provides a detailed examination of cancer mortality trends in Scotland over 25 years, alongside population data. The findings and visualizations offer valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals aiming to understand and address cancer mortality.
